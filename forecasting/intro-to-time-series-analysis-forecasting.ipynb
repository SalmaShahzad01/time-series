Important Terms to understand for Time Series Analysis \n","\n","A Time-Series is a sequence of data points collected at different timestamps. These are essentially successive measurements collected from the same data source at the same time interval. Further, we can use these chronologically gathered readings to monitor trends and changes over time. The time-series models can be univariate or multivariate. The univariate time series models are implemented when the dependent variable is a single time series, like room temperature measurement from a single sensor. On the other hand, a multivariate time series model can be used when there are multiple dependent variables, i.e., the output depends on more than one series. An example for the multivariate time-series model could be modelling the GDP, inflation, and unemployment together as these variables are linked to each other.\n","\n","### 1. Stationary and Non-Stationary Time Series\n","**Stationarity is a property of a time series.** A stationary series is one where the values of the series is not a function of time. That is, the statistical properties of the series like mean, variance and autocorrelation are constant over time. Autocorrelation of the series is nothing but the correlation of the series with its previous values, more on this coming up. **A stationary time series id devoid of seasonal effects as well.**\n","\n","### 2. Trend\n","The trend shows a general direction of the time series data over a long period of time. A trend can be increasing(upward), decreasing(downward), or horizontal(stationary).\n","\n","### 3.Seasonality \n","The seasonality component exhibits a trend that repeats with respect to timing, direction, and magnitude. Some examples include an increase in water consumption in summer due to hot weather conditions.\n","\n","### 4. Cyclical Component\n","These are the trends with no set repetition over a particular period of time. A cycle refers to the period of ups and downs, booms and slums of a time series, mostly observed in business cycles. These cycles do not exhibit a seasonal variation but generally occur over a time period of 3 to 12 years depending on the nature of the time series.\n","\n","###  5. Irregular Variation \n","These are the fluctuations in the time series data which become evident when trend and cyclical variations are removed. These variations are unpredictable, erratic, and may or may not be random.\n","\n","###  6. ETS Decomposition\n","ETS Decomposition is used to separate different components of a time series. The term ETS stands for Error, Trend and Seasonality.\n","\n","###  7. Dependence\n","It refers to the association of two observations of the same variable at prior time periods.\n","\n","###  8. Differencing\n","Differencing is used to make the series stationary and to control the auto-correlations. There may be some cases in time series analyses where we do not require differencing and over-differenced series can produce wrong estimates.\n","\n","###  9. Specification \n","It may involve the testing of the linear or non-linear relationships of dependent variables by using time series models such as ARIMA models.\n","\n","###  10.

We talk about these correlations using the term ‚Äúlags.‚Äù Analysts record time-series data by measuring a characteristic at evenly spaced intervals‚Äîsuch as daily, monthly, or yearly. The number of intervals between the two observations is the lag. For example, the lag between the current and previous observation is one. If you go back one more interval, the lag is two, and so on.\n","\n","In mathematical terms, the observations at yt and yt‚Äìk are separated by k time units. K is the lag. This lag can be days, quarters, or years depending on the nature of the data. When k=1, you‚Äôre assessing adjacent observations. For each lag, there is a correlation.\n","\n","#### Autocorrelation Function (ACF)\n","Use the autocorrelation function (ACF) to identify which lags have significant correlations, understand the patterns and properties of the time series, and then use that information to model the time series data. From the ACF, you can assess the randomness and stationarity of a time series. You can also determine whether trends and seasonal patterns are present.\n","\n","In an ACF plot, each bar represents the size and direction of the correlation. Bars that extend across the red line are statistically significant.\n","\n","#### Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)\n","The partial autocorrelation function is similar to the ACF except that it displays only the correlation between two observations that the shorter lags between those observations do not explain. For example, the partial autocorrelation for lag 3 is only the correlation that lags 1 and 2 do not explain. In other words, the partial correlation for each lag is the unique correlation between those two observations after partialling out the intervening correlations.\n","\n","As you saw, the autocorrelation function helps assess the properties of a time series. In contrast, the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is more useful during the specification process for an autoregressive model. Analysts use partial autocorrelation plots to specify regression models with time series data and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. I‚Äôll focus on that aspect in posts about those methods.\n","\n","*https://statisticsbyjim.com/time-series/autocorrelation-partial-autocorrelation/*"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import acf, pacf\n","from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf\n","\n","df = train[(train['country']=='Belgium')&(train['product']=='Kaggle Advanced Techniques')&(train['store']=='KaggleMart')]\n","df['value']=df['num_sold']\n","\n","acf_50 = acf(df.value, nlags=50)\n","pacf_50 = pacf(df.value, nlags=50)\n","\n","# Draw Plot\n","fig, axes = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(16,3), dpi= 100)\n","plot_acf(df.value.tolist(), lags=50, ax=axes[0])\n","plot_pacf(df.value.tolist(), lags=50, ax=axes[1])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<div style=\"padding:20px;color:black;margin:0;font-size:250%;text-align:center;display:fill;border-radius:5px;background-color:#aaf0f0;overflow:hidden;font-weight:700;border: 5px solid #21a3a3;\"> üìñ Lag plots</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# üìñ 13.
